          Welcome to Kampung Dunedin, where the flavors of Malaysia meet the
          heart of Dunedin, New Zealand.

        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed md:text-lg">
          We are a small, family-owned food business with a passion for sharing
          authentic Malaysian cuisine. Our journey began with a simple longing
          for home â€” the familiar taste of spices, the aroma of pandan leaves,
          and the warmth of dishes that remind us of the bustling streets and
          vibrant hawker stalls of Malaysia.

          Being away from our <span className="italic">kampung</span> (village)
          has taught us the true meaning of comfort food. It&apos;s not just
          about the taste; it&apos;s about the memories, the togetherness, and
          the stories shared over a meal. That&apos;s why we started Kampung
          Dunedin, to bring a piece of our culture, traditions, and love for
          food to this beautiful city.
