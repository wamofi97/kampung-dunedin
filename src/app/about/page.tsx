          We are a small, family-owned food business with a passion for sharing
          authentic Malaysian cuisine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our journey began with a simple longing for home â€“ the familiar taste
          of spices, the aroma of pandan and banana leaves, and simple dishes
          that remind us of the vibrant hawker stalls in Malaysia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being away from our{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold italic">kampung</span> (village) has
          taught us the true meaning of comfort food.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s not just about the taste, but also, the memories of eating
          together as a community, and stories shared over our meals.
        </p>
        <p>
          We prepare dishes that hold a special place in our hearts (and
          tummies). Our recipes are crafted with care, using authentic
          techniques and passed down through generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope to build a community in ÅŒtepoti Dunedin through Kampung
          Dunedin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for supporting our journey. From our kitchen to your home,
          we hope to bring you a taste of our village.{" "}
