    text: "I have zero regrets trying each item on their menu because it was beyond delicious. The spiciness was just right - mild enough for someone like me to enjoy, but with just the right amount of kick from the spices to bring out those flavors. This means both those with low spice tolerance and those who enjoy extra heat in their food can enjoy it!",

It's probably the first Malaysian cuisine I have eaten in Dunedin and it is tastes amazing!! ü§©ü§© Loved the Nasi Lemak the most and how authentic it looks and tastes! 10/10! It just can't get any better! Best of all is the additional sambal üòçüòç",
